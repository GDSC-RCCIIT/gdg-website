        extendedContent: `
            This roadmap covers everything you need to know about frontend development. 
            You'll start by learning HTML and CSS, which are the building blocks of any website. 
            Then, you'll dive into JavaScript, the language that adds interactivity to web pages.
            
            After getting comfortable with the basics, the roadmap introduces modern JavaScript frameworks 
            like React, Vue, or Angular, which are essential for building dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs). 
            You'll also learn about CSS preprocessors (e.g., SASS), build tools (e.g., Webpack), 
            and front-end performance optimization techniques.
            
            Advanced topics include state management (e.g., Redux), accessibility, responsive design, 
            and progressive web apps (PWA). By the end of this roadmap, you'll be able to design and develop 
            complex, user-friendly, and responsive web interfaces.

        extendedContent: `
            Backend development focuses on server-side logic, databases, and application architecture.
            You'll start by learning the basics of HTTP, web servers, and databases (both SQL and NoSQL).
            
            This roadmap will guide you through setting up servers using different backend languages 
            such as Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Java (Spring), or Ruby on Rails. You'll also explore 
            RESTful API development, authentication methods (e.g., JWT, OAuth), and database interactions using ORM libraries.
            
            As you advance, you'll learn about cloud deployment, scaling applications, 
            microservices architecture, and best practices for security, testing, and performance optimization.
            Mastering backend development will enable you to build efficient, scalable, and secure web applications.

        extendedContent: `
            User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design are crucial for creating products that users find intuitive and enjoyable.
            This roadmap will help you understand the principles of UX design, such as user research, personas, 
            wireframing, prototyping, and user testing.
            
            You'll also dive into UI design, learning about visual hierarchy, color theory, typography, and modern design tools 
            like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD. The goal is to master the skills required to create aesthetically pleasing 
            and user-friendly interfaces.
            
            Furthermore, this roadmap includes information on accessibility (ensuring your designs are usable for everyone) 
            and the latest trends in UI/UX, including motion design, micro-interactions, and adaptive design for multiple devices.

            C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language commonly used for systems programming, game development, 
            and competitive programming. This roadmap will start with the basics of C++, including syntax, loops, functions, 
            and data structures.
            
            You'll then move into object-oriented programming (OOP), covering key concepts like classes, inheritance, 
            polymorphism, and templates. The roadmap also introduces advanced topics such as memory management, 
            pointers, and file handling.
            
            In the final stages, you'll explore algorithms, data structures like trees, graphs, and dynamic programming, 
            which are crucial for competitive programming and technical interviews. This comprehensive roadmap will help 
            you master C++ and build robust, high-performance applications.
